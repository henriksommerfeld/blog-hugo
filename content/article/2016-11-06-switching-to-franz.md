When my desktop application for Facebook Messenger, [Messenger or Desktop][1], wanted me to install an update and I found out that the update wanted to install a web browser extension and otherwise pollute my computer, I uninstalled it.

Having a desktop app can sometimes be convenient, even though it has basically the same functionality as the corresponding web interface. So, I googled and found [Franz][2], a desktop messaging app that supports a bunch of messaging services and is available for Windows, Mac and Linux. So far I like it.
