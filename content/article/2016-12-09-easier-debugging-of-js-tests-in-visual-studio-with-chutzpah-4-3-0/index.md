If you have a Visual Studio project that uses [Chutzpah][1] for JavaScript tests, things recently got a lot easier with a long-awaited update.

## Problem

When all tests pass with the Chutzpah test runner everything is fine, but when you need to debug a test, things haven't been as easy. Debugging the JS code in Visual Studio is something I never got working and never really cared about anyway. The best debugging tool for JavaScript is of course the web browser, but when selecting _Open in browser_ in Visual Studio, Chutzpah has served the HTML test page (Jasmine in my case) through the `FILE:///` protocol. If you use fixtures, json files or similar, you've had to run the web browser with disabled security.

The path opened in the browser has looked something like this: `file:///C:/Workspaces/Development/Apps/CoolProject/JavascriptSpecs/_Chutzpah.32ac122b2d7b8f062865a46153b768fde2c181d4.test.html`

As a result of this more tests failed when I started debugging in the browser compared to what the test runner in Visual Studio complained about.

## Solution

As of the 4.3.0 release of Chutzpah you can enable the tests to be served through `HTTP://` instead, but it isn't enabled by default. The `BrowserArguments` I've used to disable security can be removed. See [Matthew Manela's post][2] about it for configuration options.

{{<code json>}}
"Server": {
  "Enabled": true
},

"BrowserArguments": { 
  "chrome": "--allow-file-access-from-files --allow-file-access"
}
{{</code>}}

Now the _Open in browser_ opens a path similar to this: `http://localhost:39597/Workspaces/Development/Apps/CoolProject/JavascriptSpecs/_Chutzpah.35722df6731f3d62f68cbf6a873ca82068c8446e.test.html` and only the test that should fail, fails.

So, make sure you have the latest version and enable the server mode in Chutzpah.json, then it's all good. Thank you Matthew for this great improvement!
