Approaching 40 years old and two years since I changed direction as a software developer, I conclude that the grass really _is_ greener on the other side. Perhaps I should have jumped earlier.

## Where I'm coming from

Most of my career I've been a consultant working with [.Net][3] development and specialised in [SharePoint][4] (described in [_Getting a Divorce From SharePoint_][5]). When I read [The Phoenix Project][2] I strongly identified with the pre-transformation description and the different characters described in that book. At one time, me and a colleague had a great laugh comparing our work situation to the film [The Martian][1] (where the main character is stuck alone on March, click the link and see the trailer to get a feeling for what I mean). Our job felt just as complex and challenging – and we were only maintaining a bloody website! To be fair, it was a website selling products for a couple of hundred million EUR annually, but still.

Not all problems should be solved, some should be avoided. When things are complicated due to accidental technical debt rather than complex due to supporting a complex world, walk away. 

Another aspect of your career is how much you learn over time. Do I have x years of experience or 1 year of experience x times?

Sample tech:
* [Visual Studio [year] (Not responding)™][20]
* .Net Framework 4.x
* Team Foundation Server (using TFVC)
* SharePoint Server
* MS SQL Server
* Windows Server
* Virtual machines weighing 100+ GB
* [Lenovo P50][6] with 64 GB RAM
* README for monthly "deploy weekend"



## Where I'm now

Currently I'm part of a _tooling_ team that provides the infrastructure and tools for other development teams to run their applications (micro services) on. As a dev in our organisation, you create a new service by using our CLI. It will ask you a few questions: name and description for the service, what team owns it, should it be accessible from the Internet, do you have an existing repository, etc. 

We try to use as many open source pieces as possible when laying our puzzle. We buy commercial software as well when we find that's the best option, but we don't buy a product that claims it do everything. 

Event storming, event sourcing...

Sample tech:
* [Visual Studio Code][19] (still avoid [Vim][18])
* JavaScript/TypeScript
* Go
* [NodeJS][13] with [koa][14] or [Apollo Server][15]
* [Docker][10], Terraform, [Nomad][11], [Consul][12], [Jenkins][9], [Neo4j][16], [Grafana][8], [Graylog][7]...
* [Mob][21] station with large TV and [Ubuntu Linux][23] [NUC][22] + personal [MacBook Pro 16"][17]
