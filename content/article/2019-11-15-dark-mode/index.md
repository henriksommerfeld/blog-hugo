So, I decided to implement dark mode on my website (to tackle parental leave boredom). I'll describe what I did and what I could have done differently in hindsight in these areas:

* Different CSS files VS `body` selector
* Provide a switch between modes?
* Messing up Sass variables and CSS variables
* Adjust images with filter

## Background

Supporting different themes on a website is very simple, I remember that I built three different themes that you could choose between on my website almost 20 years ago when I was learning about CSS and the semantic web. It's just a matter of switching .css files. Those themes had different layout where the navigation would be placed differently and much more. Dark/light mode is just a matter of changing colours. 

Of course the web has evolved a bit since the Web's youth. The basic techniques you need today are:

* [CSS variables][1]
* [Media queries][4]

<figure class="image-border">
    <img src="dark-mode.gif" alt="Animated gif of toggling dark mode on my website from Windows dark/light mode" width="1668" height="908">
    <figcaption><em>This shows how toggling between light and dark mode in Windows 10 changes the theme on my website as well. </em></figcaption>
</figure>

My starting point was the extensive blog post named [_Hello darkness, my old friend_][2]. It gives a background and describes an implementation that I pretty much followed. 

It uses a `light.css` and a `dark.css` which are conditionally loaded with media queries. These files define the same set of [CSS variables][1] that are then used in a `main.css`.

```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/dark.css" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/light.css" media="(prefers-color-scheme: no-preference), (prefers-color-scheme: light)">    
```

This works great and uses the theme of the operating system, here _light_ theme is the default if the browser doesn't provide this information. It's when you add the possibility to manually switch between themes it becomes a bit more complicated.

## Different CSS files VS `body` selector
A slightly different approach is to place the media query inside a `main.css` and include all the CSS variables there. My site is build with Hugo and uses one main CSS file, rather than a component system, so I don't have any deferring of non-critical CSS anyway. Given that, I think a few extra CSS variables wouldn't make difference. 

In that case I could set a class or data attribute on the body tag and use that as my condition in CSS.

```
<body class="dark-theme">
``` 

## Provide a switch between modes?
Do you really need a switch or is it sufficient with the device setting for light/dark? If I hadn't taken the extra steps of adding a switch, it would have been a lot simpler,  and maybe good enough, in hindsight. Given that I have a switch, borrowed from [_Pure CSS Smooth Toggle Swtich Demo_][3], I think it would have been easier to toggle a CSS class or data attribute than modifying the CSS link tags like I do.

## Messing up Sass variables and CSS variables

A stupid mistake I made a couple of times during development was to confuse the syntax of Sass/SCSS variables and CSS variables, especially when using Sass functions such as `lighten`, `darken` and `transparentize`. Since CSS variables aren't checked at compile time, a few Sass variables sneaked into the resulting CSS file.


{{<code css "hl_lines=3">}}
--color: #CBD5E0;
--accent-color: #ED8936;
--color-published: #{darken(var(--color), 10%)}; /* somewhat tricky syntax */
--background-color: #2D3748;
--blockquote-color: var(--accent-color);
--header-text-shadow: rgba(26,32,44,0.5);
{{</code>}}

## Adjust images with filter
A bonus feature I borrowed straight from [_Hello darkness, my old friend_][2] is to mute images a bit. I didn't want to go to the extremes, but I do decrease brightness and saturation somewhat in dark mode.

{{<code css>}}
/* light.scss */
:root {
    --image-filter: none;
}

/* dark.scss */
:root {
    --image-filter: brightness(0.9) saturate(0.9) drop-shadow(0px 0px 2px #{$gray900});
}

/* main.scss */
figure img {
    filter: var(--image-filter);
}
{{</code>}}
