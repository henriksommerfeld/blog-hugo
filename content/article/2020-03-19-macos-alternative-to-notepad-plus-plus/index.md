Having switched from Windows to Mac quite recently, there is one application in particular that I'm missing – [Notepad++][1].

After trying _[Notes][3]_ and _[Stickes][4]_, _[Brackets][2]_ and a bunch of others, I had to rethink what I was actually using Notepad++ for and which characteristics I was appreciating the most. 

## What I was looking for
* Paste text unformatted
* Plain text by default/only
* Saves automatically
* Free of charge

I concluded that I used Notepad++ for short snippets of text where the low barrier to entry was key. Quickly opening the app and pasting something; or writing a text for a web form that I suspect will just reload and loose my text. 

Surprisingly many text editing tools don't paste unformatted text by default. Apple's _Stickes_ allow you to paste unformatted with the key combination ⌥ ⇧ ⌘ V (trying doing that with one hand!). Both _Stickes_ and _Notes_ change single quote (`'`) to some other character ( ‘ ), which messes up my [Cypher][5] queries.

I already use a heavy-weight app/service for my notes ([OneNote][7]) an several windows of [VS Code][8] for coding, so I wanted something _else_ for these kind of quick notes.

## What I was NOT looking for
* An editor that greets me with a login form
* Todos, reminders or other feature bloat

## 👑 Best so far 

_[Standard Notes][6]_ is my choice for now, installable by `brew cask install standard-notes`.

Any suggestions that _you_ like is welcome, please comment.
